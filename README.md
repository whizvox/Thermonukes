# Thermonukes

## Introduction

A Minecraft mod that adds all sorts of methods of destruction, including high explosives, radiation, and more to come.
Originally inspired by Calclavia's ICBM mod.

Currently not in a playable nor stable state. Needs much more work done before this is achieved.

## How to Run

### IntelliJ / Eclipse / VSCode

1. *IntelliJ*: Run the `genIntelliJRuns` Gradle task
2. *Eclipse*: Run the `genEclipseRuns` Gradle task
3. *VSCode*: Run the `genVSCodeRuns` Gradle task
4. Execute the newly-created `runClient` run configuration.

### Other IDE / No IDE

1. Execute `./gradlew runClient` in the terminal

If you're not sure what any of this means, I don't recommend you try to run this outside of an official release.
